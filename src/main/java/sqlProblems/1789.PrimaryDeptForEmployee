Return the result table in any order.

Answer:
select employee_id, department_id from Employee where primary_flag = 'Y' or employee_id in (select employee_id from Employee group by employee_id having count(employee_id) < 2);

Example 1:

Input:
Employee table:
+-------------+---------------+--------------+
| employee_id | department_id | primary_flag |
+-------------+---------------+--------------+
| 1           | 1             | N            |
| 2           | 1             | Y            |
| 2           | 2             | N            |
| 3           | 3             | N            |
| 4           | 2             | N            |
| 4           | 3             | Y            |
| 4           | 4             | N            |
+-------------+---------------+--------------+
Output:
+-------------+---------------+
| employee_id | department_id |
+-------------+---------------+
| 1           | 1             |
| 2           | 1             |
| 3           | 3             |
| 4           | 3             |
